Sure! Below is the Indemnity Agreement with the necessary information filled in based on the context you provided. I’ll assume your jurisdiction is the United States and that Mr. Stosh and 123 Inc. are based there. If you need adjustments to the jurisdiction or any other specifics, feel free to provide more details.

INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

This Indemnity Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the 15th day of January, 2025 by and between:
	1.	Mr. Stosh, an individual (“Indemnitor”), and
	2.	123 Inc., a corporation duly organized under the laws of the United States (“Indemnitor”).

WHEREAS:
	•	The Indemnitor is involved in creating, distributing, and/or operating software, products, or services, which may be used by individuals or entities (“Users”).
	•	The Indemnitor desires to limit their liability and protect themselves against any legal action, claims, or losses arising from the use or misuse of said software, products, or services.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

1. Indemnification

The Indemnitor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Mr. Stosh, 123 Inc., and their employees, officers, directors, agents, affiliates, and representatives (collectively “Indemnitees”) from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, judgments, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or in connection with:
	•	The use, distribution, or modification of any software, products, or services created, owned, or provided by the Indemnitor.
	•	Any claims related to infringement of intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any other legal rights caused by the use of said software, products, or services.
	•	Any breach of representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement.

2. Limitation of Liability

The Indemnitor shall not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to the use of any software, products, or services, even if the Indemnitor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Furthermore, the Indemnitor’s total liability under this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of direct damages not exceeding the total amount paid by the User for the relevant software, product, or service.

3. No Warranty

The Indemnitor makes no representations or warranties regarding the quality, accuracy, or functionality of the software, products, or services. The software, products, and services are provided “as is,” and the Indemnitor disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

4. Defense of Claims

In the event that a claim is made against the Indemnitees that is subject to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall have the right, at their own expense, to assume the defense of such claim with counsel of their choice, subject to the Indemnitees’ consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnitor agrees to promptly notify the Indemnitees of any such claim and to cooperate in the defense of the claim.

5. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid provision that closely approximates the original intent of the parties.

6. Entire Agreement

This Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, between the parties. Any amendments to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.

7. Governing Law
