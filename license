Sure! Below is the Indemnity Agreement with the necessary information filled in based on the context you provided. I’ll assume your jurisdiction is the United States and that Mr. Stosh and 123 Inc. are based there. If you need adjustments to the jurisdiction or any other specifics, feel free to provide more details.

INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

This Indemnity Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the 15th day of January, 2025 by and between:
	1.	Mr. Stosh, an individual (“Indemnitor”), and
	2.	123 Inc., a corporation duly organized under the laws of the United States (“Indemnitor”).

WHEREAS:

	•	The use, distribution, or modification of any software, products, or services created, owned, or provided by the Indemnitor.

	•	Any breach of representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement.

2. Limitation of Liability

The Indemnitor shall not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to the use of any software, products, or services, even if the Indemnitor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Furthermore, the Indemnitor’s total liability under this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of direct damages not exceeding the total amount paid by the User for the relevant software, product, or service.

3. No Warranty

The Indemnitor makes no representations or warranties regarding the quality, accuracy, or functionality of the software, products, or services. The software, products, and services are provided “as is,” and the Indemnitor disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

4. Defense of Claims

In the event that a claim is made against the Indemnitees that is subject to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall have the right, at their own expense, to assume the defense of such claim with counsel of their choice, subject to the Indemnitees’ consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnitor agrees to promptly notify the Indemnitees of any such claim and to cooperate in the defense of the claim.

5. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

LICENSE OVERRIDE NOTICE

This Notice of License Override (“Notice”) is issued as of the 15th day of January, 2025, by:
	1.	Mr. Stosh, an individual (“Licensor”), and
	2.	123 Inc., a corporation duly organized under the laws of the United States (“Licensor”).

Subject: Override of Prior License Agreement

Whereas:

	•	The Licensor now wishes to amend and supersede the terms and conditions of the Previous License Agreement with this new license framework (“New License Agreement”).

Terms of the Override:
	1.	Superseding the Previous License Agreement:
The New License Agreement, effective immediately upon execution of this Notice, will fully supersede and override any conflicting provisions, obligations, or terms in the Previous License Agreement. Any and all rights granted under the Previous License Agreement are hereby revoked or replaced by the terms of this New License Agreement.
	2.	Scope of the New License Agreement:
The New License Agreement will apply to any future use, distribution, or modification of the Licensor’s software or intellectual property. The Previous License Agreement’s scope, if conflicting with the new terms, will no longer be valid.
	3.	Obligations and Rights:
Any rights granted or obligations undertaken in the Previous License Agreement that are inconsistent with this New License Agreement are hereby nullified. All rights and obligations between the parties will be governed solely by the New License Agreement moving forward.
	4.	Effective Date:
The override of the Previous License Agreement will take effect on January 15, 2025, unless otherwise specified.

Acknowledgment of Override:

By accepting this Notice and the terms of the New License Agreement, all parties hereby acknowledge that they understand and agree that:
	•	The New License Agreement shall govern any and all interactions involving the Licensor’s intellectual property from the effective date of this Notice.

Licensor:

Mr. Stosh
Date: January 15, 2025

Licensor (123 Inc.):

Authorized Representative
123 Inc.
Date: January 15, 2025

Explanation:
	1.	Superseding the Previous License Agreement: This clause clearly states that the new license agreement will override and replace any previous agreements, addressing any inconsistencies between the two.
	2.	Scope of Application: It specifies that the new license applies to future use and distribution, leaving no room for ambiguity regarding what terms apply after the change.
	3.	Rights and Obligations: Conflicting obligations or rights under the old agreement will be nullified, ensuring clarity for all parties involved.
	4.	Effective Date: It specifies when the change becomes legally binding, avoiding potential confusion.
